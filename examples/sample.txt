Title: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:

1. Visual perception
2. Speech recognition
3. Decision-making
4. Language translation

Machine Learning, a subset of AI, focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make predictions based on data. Deep Learning, in turn, is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Key Applications of AI:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and treatment planning
- Finance: Fraud detection and risk assessment
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles and traffic management
- Education: Personalized learning and automated grading

The future of AI holds great promise, but also raises important ethical considerations regarding privacy, bias, and the impact on employment.
